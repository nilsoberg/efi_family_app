parameters :
    job_name :
        ui-name : |
            Job name
        short-hint : |
            The name of the output dataset
        long-hint : |
            The name of the output dataset
    family_name :
        ui-name : |
            Family name
        short-hint : |
            One or more InterPro and UniProt families, space-separated
        long-hint  : |
            InterPro and UniProt families define sets of related proteins. This app can take one or more family names separated by spaces
    use_uniref :
        ui-name : |
            UniRef type
        short-hint : |
            UniRef reduces family size by 50% and 90% seqeuence similarity
        long-hit : |
            UniRef reduces family size by protein sequence similarity. UniRef50 is 50% identity over 80% of the length of the sequence, and UniRef90 is 90% identity over 80% of the length of the sequence.
    blast_sequence :
        ui-name : |
            Protein sequence
        short-hint : |
            Protein sequence used in BLAST
        long-hint : |
            Protein sequence used in BLAST. Retrieves sequences similar to the input sequence.
    fasta_text : 
        ui-name : |
            FASTA sequences
        short-hint : |
            Protein sequences in FASTA format
        long-hint : |
            Protein sequences in FASTA format. These are used in the BLAST to determine similarity, and allow custom sequences to be utilized.
    accession_text :
        ui-name : |
            Accession IDs
        short-hint : |
            UniProt and/or NCBI protein accession IDs
        long-hint : |
            A list of UniProt and/or NCBI protein accession IDs. Sequences from these IDs are retrieved to determine similarity.

        short-hint : |
            The EFI-EST BLAST option
    option_family :
        ui-name : |
            Families
        short-hint : |
