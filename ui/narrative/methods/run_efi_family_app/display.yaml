parameters :
    job_name :
        ui-name : |
            Job name
        short-hint : |
            The name of the output dataset
        long-hint : |
            The name of the output dataset

    fam_family_name :
        ui-name : |
            Family name
        short-hint : |
            One or more InterPro and UniProt families, space-separated
        long-hint  : |
            InterPro and UniProt families define sets of related proteins. This app can take one or more family names separated by spaces
    fam_use_uniref :
        ui-name : |
            UniRef type
        short-hint : |
            UniRef reduces family size by 50% and 90% seqeuence similarity
        long-hit : |
            UniRef reduces family size by protein sequence similarity. UniRef50 is 50% identity over 80% of the length of the sequence, and UniRef90 is 90% identity over 80% of the length of the sequence.
    fam_exclude_fragments :
        ui-name : |
            Exclude Fragments
        short-hint : |
            Excludes fragment sequences if selected.
        long-hint : |
            'UniProt designates a Sequence Status for each member: Complete if the encoding DNA sequence has both start and stop codons; Fragment if the start and/or stop codon is missing. Approximately 10% of the entries in UniProt are fragments. For the UniRef90 and UniRef50 databases, clusters are excluded if the cluster ID ("representative sequence") is a fragment. UniProt IDs in UniRef90 and UniRef50 clusters with complete cluster IDs are removed from the clusters if they are fragments.'

    blast_sequence :
        ui-name : |
            Protein sequence
        short-hint : |
            Protein sequence used in BLAST
        long-hint : |
            Protein sequence used in BLAST. Retrieves sequences similar to the input sequence.
    blast_exclude_fragments :
        ui-name : |
            Exclude Fragments
        short-hint : |
            Excludes fragment sequences if selected.
        long-hint : |

            FASTA sequences
        short-hint : |
            Protein sequences in FASTA format
        long-hint : |
            Protein sequences in FASTA format. These are used in the BLAST to determine similarity, and allow custom sequences to be utilized.
    fasta_exclude_fragments :
        ui-name : |
            Exclude Fragments
        short-hint : |
            Excludes fragment sequences if selected.

            Accession IDs
        short-hint : |
            UniProt and/or NCBI protein accession IDs
        long-hint : |
            A list of UniProt and/or NCBI protein accession IDs. Sequences from these IDs are retrieved to determine similarity.
    acc_exclude_fragments :
        ui-name : |

        short-hint : |
            Excludes fragment sequences if selected.
